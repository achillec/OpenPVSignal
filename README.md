# OpenPVSignal
An ontology facilitating the publishing of pharmacovigilance signal information using Linked Data and Semantic Web paradigm.

This ontology is currently under development. It is the subject of a currently ongoing research work, on how pharmacovigilance signal information could be better communicated and processed. A scientific paper is currently under development.

The ontology is versioned following the semantic versioning scheme (https://semver.org/), applying the guidelines provided by https://github.com/dbrock/semver-howto/blob/master/README.md.

For further information or guidance on how you could contribute to OpenPVSignal development, please communicate with Pantelis Natsiavas (pnatsiavas@certh.gr).
