# OpenPVSignal
An ontology facilitating the publishing of pharmacovigilance signal information using Linked Data and Semantic Web paradigm.

This ontology is currently under development. It is the subject of a currently ongoing research work, on how pharmacovigilance signal information could be better communicated and processed. A scientific paper is currently under development.

The ontology is versioned following the semantic versioning scheme (https://semver.org/), applying the guidelines provided by https://github.com/dbrock/semver-howto/blob/master/README.md. The last part of the version refers to the date that this version has been created. For example, version 0.8.20171211 is the version that has been first commited on GitHub, on 2017, 11th of December. Typically, each new version should be worked on a branch, following the rationale presented in http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/.
