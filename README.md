# OpenPVSignal
OpenPVSignal is an ontology aiming to foster the publication of pharmacovigilance signal information (currently communicated by drug regulatory authorities in free-text reports), using Linked Data and Semantic Web technologies.

OpenPVSignal is currently under development. It is currently in the final development phase, while a scientific paper about OpenPVSignal is currently being prepared.

The ontology is versioned following the semantic versioning scheme (https://semver.org/), applying the guidelines provided by https://github.com/dbrock/semver-howto/blob/master/README.md. The last part of the version refers to the date that this version has been created. For example, version 0.8.20171211 is the vertion that has been first commited on GitHub, on 2017, 11th of December. Typically, each new version should be worked on a branch, following the rationale presented in http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/.

For further information or guidance on how you could contribute to OpenPVSignal development, please contact Pantelis Natsiavas (pnatsiavas@certh.gr) and Dr. Vassilis Koutkias (vkoutkias@certh.gr).
